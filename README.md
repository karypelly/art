# Through-The-Lens-Darkly
A Javascript Photo Gallery

This Javascript photo gallery can disply your photos/sketches/paintings to viewers world-wide on the web. You will need your own photos (am I being obvious?) and your own web hosting arrangements (not supplied). The code underlying the gallery includes HTML, Javascript, CSS and two teaspoons of .php.

The pros and cons of this photo gallery include the following:

Pros:
  * Free code
  * No advertisments
  * Displays nicely on any size screen, whether mobile, tablet or PC
  * Has both thumbnails and full size photos
  * Has a simple user interface
  * Has search by photo title and by photo position in gallery
  * Can display a variety of information for each photo including title, copyright, date and place of image, photographer's name, options for an html link to more information,           and a "miscellaneous other" information field. Extra info fields could be added.
  * Has an option to receive user comments and password protect them
  * You can see the functionality on display at my own photo gallery, https://gallery.staadecker.com

Cons:
  * No slick upload interface for adding images to the web host - you need to provide your own FTP or similar upload mechansim from your PC (or whatever device) to your web              host, and to understand the file structures on your web host.
  * When you upload new images to your web host, you need to do so in both larger version for display, and in thumbnail version for quick user overview, and make manual code             additions to both an HTML file and to the Javascript file. 
  * When you set a password to guard access to user comments you will be manually changing a .php file on your webhost.
  * The gallery relies on mix of technologies including HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, FTP. Your web host needs to support PHP and you need to be comfortable making at least              rudimentary changes - guided by the user manual - if needed, with these technologies.
  * I do provide a user manual, but do not provide support.

User Manual:
  * Provided in a separate document.

  Demo
   * I have used this gallery for several years (with some evolution over time) for displaying my own photos. You can see the functionality of the gallery at                        https://gallery.staadecker.com 
    
 Usual disclaimers: All electrons consumed by my computer in creating this program were humanely caught. No leghold traps were used. This program works for me, I make no guarantees of any kind whether it will work for you or even if it is error free. If you use it, your comments and suggestions are welcome.
